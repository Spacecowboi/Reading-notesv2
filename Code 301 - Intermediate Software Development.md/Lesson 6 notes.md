# Psychological safety and REST

### The Quest

1. To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience? 

* Unfortunately in my previous work experience, psychological safety was not exactly a top priority and therefore was not a consideration.

2. How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

* Taking into account the psychological safety and feelings of my team and cohort needs to be a top priority. If we are all on the same page with our understanding of respecting each other's opinions and creating space for us to be heard, we will be sure to be successful.

### REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

* He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

* Because most of the techniques that we use in class are restricted to importing data (so far) from a file or handling things locally. 

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

* It is a protocol capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world, FROM anywhere in the world. It is the foundation of the web. 

4. What does a GET do?

* Sends out a request to recieve information

5. What does a POST do?

* If we need to **add** something to another system, it uses an HTTP verb of POST

6. What does PUT do?

* IF we need to **replace** something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT. 

7. What does PATCH do?

* Implements a *partial* update.
