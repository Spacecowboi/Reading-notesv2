# Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging

### That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

* The personal computer started appearing far more in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

* When the children of the early computer generation finally made it to college, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home. However, that was not the case for women as they hadn't been given the opportunity that men in that same age bracket had been given.

### Why Diversity Matters

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

* "Diversity efforts are most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters."

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

* Diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogenous ones

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

* From the article: "When YouTube's almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies."
