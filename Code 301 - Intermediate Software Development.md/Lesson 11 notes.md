# MongoDB and Mongoose

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

* Structured data that can fit into a table (tabular data)
* RWE: An online store's database for customer orders and products. (E-commerce)

2. What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?

* Data that is more linear and capable of satisfying the requirement of key-value pairs. Data that would display well on a graph or document.
* RWE: Social Media platform - allows dynamic updating of user data over time.

3. Which type of database is best for hierarchial data storage?

* For hierarchial data storage, the best would be NoSQL.

4. Which type of database is best for scalability?

* Scalability = SQL Databases

1. What does SQL stand for?

* Structured Query Language - a domain-specific language that manages databases

2. What is a relational database?

* A specific type of DB that organizes and stores data in tables with predefined relationships between them.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

* They work with structured 'schemas' that define tables, columns, etc.

4. What is a 'schema'?

* A relational database that defiens the strucutre of the DB

5. What is a NoSQL database?

* A type of DB that is designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and provide flexible schemas

6. How does it work?

* They assign data models to key-value pairs, then put that data into a document, column, or graph to organize that data.

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?

* A whole bunch of JSON-ish documents that are in "collections", which are like the tables in SQL.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why?

* MongoDB is *slightly* more flexible because it doesn't need a fixed schema.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

* Lack of a standarized language so it's harder for developers to switch between NoSQL systems. NoSQL tends to lack many features and tools compared to SQL.
