# React-Cookies Component

1. Describe some react-cookie features

* Cookie management gives you the CRUD process but for cookie in storage.

* You can select options for your cookies as well, if you want to specify things like expiration dates or pathing options.

2. Describe some react-cookies features

* With this libary you're able to do most of the same things as react-cookie, but I think it's more useful for API integration

3. Which libarary would you prefer and why?
