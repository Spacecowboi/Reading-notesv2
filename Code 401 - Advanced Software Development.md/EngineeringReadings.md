## DQ

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

* I believe I bring strong adaptability and resilience. 

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* Ask for help and be more descriptive with the "how, what, why" of my problem.
* Take breaks and allow myself to breathe when I don't understand something
* Keep my debugging simple and concise. Think broadly and try to narrow my scope. (This is where I struggle the most)
