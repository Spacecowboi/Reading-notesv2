# What is an expression in JavaScript?
* An expression in JS is a segment of code that successfully produces a value. They can be simple or crazy complex, have numbers, letters, both.

## Why should we use loops in our code?
* Loops guarantee a way to get a program or code to do a specific task repeatedly. This can make your code more concise.

# When does a *for* loop stop executing?
* A *for* loop will continue executing until a specified condition evaluates to false. "Good, good, good, keep going, good, FALSE. STOP."

# How many times will a *while* loop execute?
* A *while* loop will execute its statemetns as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. When the condition becomes false, the statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
