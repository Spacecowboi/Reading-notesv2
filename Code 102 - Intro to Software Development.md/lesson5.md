# What is the purpose of CSS?

  * CSS adds style and design to the barebones shell of HTML. CSS allows you to make your project or website more aesthetically pleasing by allowing the user to style what the user will see and interact with.

## What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

  * External CSS (Loads the styles from a different place)
  * Internal CSS (Completed using style tags within the html file)
  * Inline CSS (Used for specific targeting purposes within the html)

## Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text

p {
    color: red;
}
