# DEBUGGINS

## What is going on in JS?

    1. Name some key differences between a *syntax error* and a *logic error*
        * I think some big differences are really the nature of each type of error. For example, a syntax error is when something is spelled incorrectly or misplaced, but a logic error is when your code runs successfully but produces an unexpected result or gives something that is incorrect.
        * Logic I think is more difficult to figure out because it doesn't happen right away, you can spend all day writing something and hoping it will work but then get an unexpected result which then causes you to fall down the debugging rabbit hole.

    2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
        * One problem I had was JavaScript not registering the correct data type because I had not used the right syntax to discern if my parameters were strings or numbers. Similarly, another issue was where I had been using double quotes to annotate a string value, but during the compilation process it was not registering as such.

    3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
        * Well I certainly need to be more aware of my console logs and running debugger statements. I'm not utilizing enough tools that help with those problems which is causing me to stay on problems way longer than I need to.

## JS DEBUGGIN TIME

    1. How would you describe the JS Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
        * The JS debugger is basically a tool you can use when you don't understand why something is not working. You can put it anywhere, but ideally you want to put it before the function or line of code that is not working. Once you do, it will go one step at a time through your function or code and show you step by step what is happening until it hits an error, and then you can see why/what is going wrong.
    
    2. Define what a breakpoint is.
        * Breakpoints are places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

    3. What is the call stack?
        * A section taht shows you waht code was executed to get to the current line.
