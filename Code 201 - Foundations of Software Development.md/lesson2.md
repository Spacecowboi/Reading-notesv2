# HTML Text Fundamentals
    * This is important as a topic because it is the backbone of software development.

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
    * Semantic elements allow us to give meaning to text so that the browser knows how to display data correctly.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
    * There are 6 heading elements in HTML

3. What are some uses for the *sup* and *sub* elements?
    * These are short for Superscript and subscript, respectively. These are used for marking up items such as dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations.

4. When using the *abbr* element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
    * The *title* attribute muse be used to provide full expansion of the term.

# Learning CSS

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
    * We can apply CSS to our HTML via inline CSS within the text of the HTML file (index.html), or we can create a file designated specifically for CSS. This is then linked with an anchor tag on the HTML.

2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?
    * The most prominent reason to avoid using inline styles is that inline styling only applies to one element of the HTML. A separate file containing all of your CSS will allow flexibility during the styling process. Being able to target the necessary portions of the HTML from the stylesheet is much more optimal.

3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
    * What is representing the selector? (h2)
    * Which components are the CSS declarations? (color: padding:)
    * Which componenets are considered properties? (color: padding:)

EX: 
    h2{
        color: black;
        padding: 5px;
    }

# Learn JS

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
    * This is known as a 'string'.

2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
    * Addition
    * Subtraction/Multiplication/Division
    * Assignment
    * Strict Equality

3. Describe a real world problem you could solve with a function.
    * Organizing a large amount of data in a specific way repeatedly. For example moving information in/out of a table of data, adding new data types, etc.

# Making decisions in your code

1. An if statement checks a *condition*  and if it evaluates to *true*, then the code block will execute.

2. What is the use of an else if?
    * This conditional statement would be used in a case where you want to have extra choices outside of the single T/F that is the conditional of an if statement.

3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.
    * === and !==
    * < and >
    * <= and =>
