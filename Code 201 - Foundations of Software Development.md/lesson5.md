# Images, Color, Text!

* Today's notes are important because these are the factors and elements that make up the aesthetic of our webpage.

## Using Images in HTML, Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

1. What is a real world use case for the *alt* attribute being used in a website? 
    * An *alt* tag is added to images in order to describe their content and function on the web page. 

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
    * Alt text is a great way. If a user is visually impaired, they can use a screen reader. 
    * Search engines can can utilize alt text with search queries to find specific images

3. Provide an example of when the *figure* element would be useful in an HTML document.
    * This is useful when you want to present an image or table, etc, along with a description or caption. It's very semantic and easy to group elements together.

4. Describe the difference between a *gif* image and an *svg* image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
    * "Okay, so a *gif*, Mr. Derrick, is an image that is animated or moves kind of an a loop. BUT,it doesn't scale, it will get grainy if you try and blow it up and make it big. An *svg* **IS** scaleable and will look crispy on any screen, including your Nokia."

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
    * PNG. PNG is great for screenshots because it's more accessible while maintaing great quality. Also good because it's readable by most browsers.

## Using Color in CSS, Styling HTML Text Elements.

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with not technical knowledge.
    * So the foreground color is basically what *YOU* are going to be seeing the most. It's the text color, the drawing on the paper so to speak. The *background* color is the color of the paper or in this case, the color of the website itself, outside of text or anything else. 

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
    * Well, without getting too crazy or niche, the first thing I would do is apply a background color. Ideally I want it to be easy on the eyes so maybe a more neutral color that I can later pair with a contrasting, lighter color depending on the nature of the content, or a darker color to sort of make things pop. 

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
    * Accessability. I want my text to be legible and useable across all browsers (for compatibility purposes), and easy to look at. So ideally I want to choose a "web-safe" font. 

4. What do *font-size*, *font-weight*, and *font-style* do to HTML text elements?
    * Font size can affects the size of the text rendered to the page via HTML
    * Font-weight is what controls how bold the text is. Has a number of values available depending on your individual needs.
    * Font-style is used to turn italic text on or off. 

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
    * The CSS property: "Padding". The *padding* property controls the space within the element. 
    * Along with *padding*, we can also use *margin* as another property. This one adds spacing around the characters within the targeted element.
