# CSS Layout

### Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional contnet. Explain what this means.
    * It's really good at taking a bunch of items that have different sizes and returning the best layout for those particular items.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
    * The main axis is the one set by your *flex-direction* property. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main acis, so *flex-direction* in this instance would run opposite of the main axis.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
    * Certain elements in HTML may be ordered a particular way in order to facilitate accessbility. Flexbox can potentially remove or alter these things in a way that negatively impacts accessibility. 

### MORE FLEXBOX

1. What are some advantages to using flexbox over float?
    * Float can be very limiting in it's versatility and capability. Flexbox removes much of that by being able to operate in a way that things like centering vertically, making children of a container take up the whole box, and making columns all adopt the same height stop becoming problems.

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
    * I really want to spend more time understanding and developing my CSS toolset. I have a very basic understanding of how CSS works but not a good idea of how to do it well. The ability to have a well designed webpage aesthetically is just as important in my opinion as the functionality in the backend.
