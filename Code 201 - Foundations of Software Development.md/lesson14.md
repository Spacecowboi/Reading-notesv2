# CSS - Transformers, Transitions, and Animations

### Transformers

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
    * Allows the developer to apply 2D transformations to an HTML element by changing it's appearance on the web page. The transformations can alter the element's size, position, and orientation which will allow for visually appealing effects.

2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
    * 2D rotate would be a simple example of a transformation. A user can hover over a box or an icon and rotate would cause the element to twist on an axis visually.
