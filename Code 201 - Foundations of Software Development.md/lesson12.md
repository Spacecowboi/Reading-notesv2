### Animated Charts with Chart.JS

1. What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?
    * Way better for displaying data visually than tables
    * Easier to look at and convey data quickly, but not always easy to create.
    * More versatile than a table

2. How could Chart.JS aid your previously created applications visually?
    * Salmon cookies probably could have used a chart to gather and explain the data that was being displayed rather than the table of genereated rows and columns. Even the styling options felt very limiting.
