## What does it mean to me?

  Growth mindset is a necessary component of progress for me personally. It means being able to overcome adversity and challenges in order to prosper and achieve goals by **facing** difficulty and affirming to myself that it's not impossible and I **_can_** overcome whatever the problem is. There are a few ways I like to remind myself to stay in this growth mindset when things become difficult and I start to feel myself losing focus.

  1. Being _keenly_ aware of my thoughts and my environment
  2. Finding inspiration
  3. Continuing to visualize goals and the progress associated with that goal

  My name is Anthony Cunningham. I have been on a long journey of trying to figure out what I want to do with my life and why. Three years ago I came to Code Fellows for the first time and had an amazing journey, and haven't found an experience quite like it since, so I returned. I have been a soldier, a scientist and technician, and hopefully soon a software engineer.
